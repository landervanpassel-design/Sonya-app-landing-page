  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: November 08, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>Welcome to Sonya ("the App"), operated by Sonya, based in Belgium ("we," "us," or "our"). The App is available worldwide, and we advertise globally. By accessing or using the App, you ("User" or "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. These Terms comply with Belgian and EU laws, with considerations for international users.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>The App is an interactive swiping experience involving fairy tales, animals, and AI-generated "prophecies" for entertainment purposes. Features include user authentication, swiping mechanics, AI insights via xAI's Grok API, and optional paid features (e.g., subscriptions, one-time unlocks). All AI content is fictional and not intended as advice.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you are of legal age and capable of forming a binding contract. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or 16 in EEA). If we discover such use, we will terminate the account.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
  <p>To access features, you must create an account with a valid email and password. You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality and all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of unauthorized access. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations.</p>
  
  <h2>4. User Conduct and Content</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App for illegal purposes or to violate laws.</li>
    <li>Upload harmful, offensive, or infringing content.</li>
    <li>Attempt to hack, reverse-engineer, or disrupt the App.</li>
    <li>Misuse AI features (e.g., for harmful decisions).</li>
  </ul>
  All user inputs (e.g., swipes) are your responsibility. We may monitor for abuse but are not liable for user content.</p>
  
  <h2>5. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Prophecies and insights are AI-generated for entertainment only. They are not accurate, reliable, or personalized advice. Do not rely on them for medical, financial, legal, or life decisions. We disclaim all liability for outcomes from using AI content. The App uses xAI's Grok API; results may vary and are not endorsed by us.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Paid features (e.g., unlocks, subscriptions) are processed via Stripe. All sales are final; no refunds except as required by law (e.g., EU 14-day cooling-off for distance sales). Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled. We may change pricing with notice. You authorize charges and are responsible for fees/taxes.</p>
  
  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, including images, AI outputs, and code, is our property or licensed. You grant us a perpetual, royalty-free license to use your inputs for improving the App. Do not reproduce or distribute App content without permission.</p>
  
  <h2>8. Data Privacy</h2>
  <p>See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for data handling. By using the App, you consent to data collection as described.</p>
  
  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits or data. Our total liability is limited to amounts paid by you in the last 12 months. The App is provided "as is" without warranties.</p>
  
  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify us from claims arising from your use of the App, violations of Terms, or infringement.</p>
  
  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may terminate your access for violations. Upon termination, your account and data may be deleted.</p>
  
  <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Belgium, without regard to conflict of law principles. For users in the European Union, you may bring disputes in the courts of your domicile in accordance with EU regulations (e.g., Brussels I Recast). For non-EU users, disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Brussels, Belgium, or through binding arbitration administered by CEPANI (Belgian Centre for Arbitration and Mediation) in Brussels. You waive any objection to venue or inconvenience. Class actions are prohibited.</p>
  
  <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update Terms with notice via email or App. Continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
